The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven distinct layers. It was developed in 1984 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)

- **Physical Layer (Layer 1):**
    - **physical medium** for data transmission, such as cables, electrical signals, or radio waves.
    - defines the hardware aspects of transmitting raw bits over a physical medium, including connectors, pins, voltage levels, and signaling.
- **Data Link Layer (Layer 2):**
    - transmission between two directly **connected nodes** (e.g., switches and network interface cards).
    - It is responsible for framing data into frames, adding **MAC** (Media Access Control) addresses for device identification, and handling error detection and correction.
- **Network Layer (Layer 3):**
    - The network layer is responsible for routing data packets between **different networks** or subnets.
    - It deals with logical addressing (e.g., **IP addresses**), packet forwarding, and choosing the best path for data to travel from the source to the destination.
- **Transport Layer (Layer 4):**
    - reliable, end-to-end data transport services between applications running on different devices.
    - ensures data integrity, flow control, and error recovery using mechanisms like [[TCP]] (Transmission Control Protocol) and [[UDP]] (User Datagram Protocol).
- **Session Layer (Layer 5):**
    - establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between applications on different devices.
    - synchronization and checkpointing of data exchange to support reliable data transfer during a session.
- **Presentation Layer (Layer 6):**
    - data representation, translation, and encryption to ensure that data sent by one application can be understood by another.
    - **data compression, data encryption, character encoding**, and data format conversion.
- **Application Layer (Layer 7):**
    - closest to the end-user.  provides a **user interface** and services for end-user applications to interact with the network.
    - It includes various application protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DNS, enabling functions such as email, web browsing, file transfer, and domain name resolution.
