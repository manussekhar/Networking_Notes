The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven distinct layers. It was developed in 1984 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)

- **Physical Layer (Layer 1):**
    
    - This layer deals with the physical medium for data transmission, such as cables, electrical signals, or radio waves.
    - It defines the hardware aspects of transmitting raw bits over a physical medium, including connectors, pins, voltage levels, and signaling.
- **Data Link Layer (Layer 2):**
    
    - The data link layer provides reliable point-to-point and point-to-multipoint data transmission between two directly connected nodes (e.g., switches and network interface cards).
    - It is responsible for framing data into frames, adding MAC (Media Access Control) addresses for device identification, and handling error detection and correction.
- **Network Layer (Layer 3):**
    
    - The network layer is responsible for routing data packets between different networks or subnets.
    - It deals with logical addressing (e.g., IP addresses), packet forwarding, and choosing the best path for data to travel from the source to the destina
