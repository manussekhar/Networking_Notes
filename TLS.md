TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a cryptographic protocol that provides secure communication over a computer network.

TLS uses encryption algorithms to scramble the data being transmitted, making it unreadable to anyone who intercepts it without the proper decryption key.

TLS guarantees that data is not altered or corrupted during transmission. It uses message authentication codes (MACs) to verify that the data received at the other end is the same as what was sent.

TLS operates in the application layer of the OSI model and sits on top of the transport layer (e.g., TCP or UDP).

he TLS protocol establishes a secure connection through a process called the "handshake." During the handshake, the client and server negotiate the encryption algorithms and other parameters to be used in the secure communication session.
